# sarenv/planning/path_generators.py

# TODO create a functional programming interface for generating tasks. This includes
#   - Polygon sweeps, both for convex and non convex polygons
#   - Task generator for different categories: Roads, boundaries, buildings
#   - Environment generator, which can define a search area based on a polygon incasing the area.
#     The environment should take potental dangerous elements in the terrain into account:
#       * Powerlines, tall buildings, etc. (This should be configurable)

# Placeholder function, to be implemented
def generate_search_tasks(geometries):
    """
    Generates search tasks based on input geometries.
    This is a placeholder and needs to be implemented.

    # Example:
    # sweep_paths = generate_lawnmower_paths(geometries['roi'], ...)
    # road_following_paths = generate_road_paths(geometries['roads'], ...)
    # return combined_paths
    print("generate_search_tasks is a placeholder.")

# You would add functions here like: TODO
# def generate_lawnmower_paths(roi_polygon: shapely.Polygon, sweep_width: float, angle_deg: float = 0.0) -> list[shapely.LineString]:
#     decomposed_cells = boustrophedon_decomposition(roi_polygon, angle_deg)
#     paths = []
#     for cell in decomposed_cells:
#         # Logic to generate coverage lines (e.g., parallel sweeps) within each cell
#         # considering sweep_width
#         pass # Placeholder
#     return paths

# Consider moving `informative_coverage` from Environment.py here if it's primarily a path generation algorithm.
